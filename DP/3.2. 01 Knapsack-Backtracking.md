# 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Table Walkthrough with Backtracking Intuition and Code

## Reminder: What We’re Solving

The **0/1 Knapsack Problem**: Maximize the total value (fun) of items selected without exceeding a weight capacity. Each item can be either taken or not taken.

## Backtracking Intuition

Once we have the `dp[n][W]` filled (maximum value), we can trace **which items** were included by backtracking:

### Key Insight:

Each cell `dp[i][w]` came from one of two options:

1. **Not taking the item** → `dp[i][w] == dp[i-1][w]`
2. **Taking the item** → `dp[i][w] == value[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weight[i-1]]`

We trace backwards:

* If value came from above (same as previous row), item was **not included**
* If value came from left-shifted row + item value, item **was included**
* When item is included, we decrease capacity `w` by its weight and continue

## C++ Code for Table Construction + Backtracking

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Function to build the DP table and return it
vector<vector<int>> buildKnapsackDP(const vector<int>& weights, const vector<int>& values, int capacity) {
    int n = weights.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(capacity + 1, 0));

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int w = 0; w <= capacity; ++w) {
            if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w], values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]]);
            } else {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
            }
        }
    }
    return dp;
}

// Function to trace back the selected items
vector<int> getSelectedItems(const vector<vector<int>>& dp, const vector<int>& weights, const vector<int>& values, int capacity) {
    vector<int> selected;
    int i = weights.size();
    int w = capacity;

    while (i > 0 && w > 0) {
        if (dp[i][w] != dp[i - 1][w]) {
            selected.push_back(i - 1); // Store the index of the selected item
            w -= weights[i - 1];
        }
        --i;
    }
    return selected;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> weights = {2, 3, 4};
    vector<int> values = {3, 4, 5};
    int capacity = 5;

    // Step 1: Build the DP table
    vector<vector<int>> dp = buildKnapsackDP(weights, values, capacity);

    // Step 2: Extract selected items
    vector<int> selected = getSelectedItems(dp, weights, values, capacity);

    // Step 3: Output the results
    cout << "Maximum Value: " << dp[weights.size()][capacity] << "\n";
    cout << "Selected items (0-based index): ";
    for (int idx : selected) {
        cout << idx << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Sample Output:

```
Maximum Value: 7
Selected items (0-based index): 1 0
```

### Meaning:

* Item 1 (weight 3, value 4)
* Item 0 (weight 2, value 3)

Total weight = 5, total value = 7 ✅

---

## Summary

* DP gives max value for each sub-capacity and sub-item set
* Backtracking uses comparisons between adjacent rows to detect if an item was included
* Final result is a list of selected items achieving optimal value

This completes the full end-to-end Knapsack with table construction + item tracing.
